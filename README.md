# freecodecamp-technical-documentation-project
The project I did for freeCodeCamp's Technical Documentation Project in the Responsive Web Design Course

I am not totally sure, or maybe have no freaking idea, what these readme's are even for, except to give important information about files? Maybe I should be going and finding out what I'm supposed to put in here... I'll go do that later, probably before I go back to learning more HTML and CSS.

So this project I've created, was supposed to be a technical document, similar functionally to the one freeCodeCamp has as their example. I couldn't think of a technical document to invent out of thin air, didn't want to waste time making shit up, so instead I went to the mdn web docs and tried to the best of my ability to make something similar to their page on "opacity".

I think I did ok. The html is terribly formatted. It doesn't look pretty at all. There is absolutely no efficiency in the CSS. It is a mess. I have spent the last three (?) days working on this project, trying to understand how to make the navbar, and multiple other aspects of the page work and work together. Not sure if I understand media queries much if at all yet.

I feel like a fetus in a world where giants roam. As in me: baby wanna be programmer having no freaking idea what I'm doing but trying so desperately, and wondering if I should be uploading a very visible trail of what my learning journey is looking like onto github.

Anyway, I am proud of myself, as should you be oh stranger who probably will never read this.
